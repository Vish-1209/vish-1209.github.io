  <h1>Hello, I’m Vishruti!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my portfolio website.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    An aspiring Data Analyst with a growing passion for Machine Learning and Data Science.  
    I work with Python, SQL, and tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to explore and visualize data.  
    Currently, I’m learning to build end-to-end projects that solve real-world problems using data.

<h2>Projects</h2>

<div>
  <h3><span style="color: black;">[ML Project]</span> 
    <p>1. Customer Churn Prediction for a Bank (Classification)</h3><p>
  <p>Objective: Predicted probability of customer churn using structured banking data (10,000 records).<p>
   <p> Performed data cleaning, EDA, and feature engineering (e.g., encoding, scaling).<p>
   <p> Handled class imbalance using SMOTE.<p>
   <p> Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, SVC, XGBoost, and Random Forest, achieving F1-score: 0.86 with RF.<p>
   <p> Used precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC metrics and feature importance to identify top churn drivers.</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SMOTE,Matplotlib</p>

  <h3>2. Food Delivery Time Prediction (Regression)</h3>
  <p>Objective: Predicted delivery time using real-world geolocation and order metadata (45,000+ records).<p>
    <p> Engineered key features like distance using geodesic calculations and prep time from timestamps.<p>
    <p> Handled missing values and inconsistent time formats during preprocessing.<p>
    <p> Trained and tuned Linear, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost Regressors using GridSearchCV.<p>
    <p> Achieved best performance using XGBoost, evaluated with MAE, RMSE, and R².<p>
    <p> Saved models with pickle and prepared data for production-like inference pipeline..</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, GridSearchCV, geopy, NumPy</p>
